Kata12: Best Sellers

Solution.


1. How would you implement this?
- There is a job which call the TopProductService every hour to load the top products from database and keep the list in memory.
- Class design
-- TopProductService
--- getTopProducts(): List<Product>
--- reloadTopProducts(topNumber, duration): void
-- Product
--- name
--- url


2. Are there any changes you could ask for to make the implementation easier?
- only 1 server. The best seller list is not shared with other servers.
- all the user see the same list


3. What would be the impact if they later came back and said:
3.1. only update the list once per day
- very small. change only the job configutaion to run the job once per day. 
3.2. we need the list updated in real time: each time the home page is displayed we need the list to reflect the 24 hours up until that point.
- very big impact. need a new implementation! 
- concept: wenn a product is sold, a asynchron event: "productSold" with the product name(assuming product name is unique) is also raised. The Event will be caught by ProductStatisticService which will increase the product sold counter by 1 in database(table:ProductStatistic) and also call TopProductService to reset the top product list. TopProductService returns the top product list from memory if it is not reset or load it from ProductStatistic in database.
- Class Design
-- ProductSellingService
--- checkout(): 
---- raise asynchron event: "productSold" with the product name at the end
-- ProductStatisticService
--- updateStatistic(productName):void  
---- observe event "productSold"
---- update productSoldStatistic: increase soldNumber of the product by 1
---- call topProductService.reset() at the end
-- ProductSoldStatistic
--- name
--- url
--- soldNumber
-- TopProductService
--- getTopProducts(): List<Product>
---- load the list from memory or database.
--- reset():void
